Takedown Instructions:
Remember that this is just a search tool, your content is not hosted here. Please be polite. There is no point in threats.
Please only provide URLs containing info_hash values. (Ex: http://getstrike.net/torrents/156B69B8643BD11849A5D8F2122E13FBB61BD041)
Takedowns that do not provide URLs with uniquely identifying info_hash values will take considerably more time to process!
Avoid sending search query URLs. List specific results you want removed.
Use your company/business email. Free mailboxes (AOL, Yahoo, Hotmail, Gmail, etc) will be ignored
Google DMCA Notice if you never done this before.
Send your takedowns in plain text to andrew@codeusa523.org only. Takedowns sent to ISPs or other addresses might not get filed properly.
